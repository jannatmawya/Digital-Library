      <h2>Summary</h2>
      <p>
        People in Glass Houses by Jayne Castle (a pseudonym for Jayne Ann
        Krentz) is a science fiction romance set in a future world where people
        with psychic abilities live in harmony with advanced technology. The
        story follows the main characters, Harriet and Sam, who are drawn
        together under unusual circumstances. <br />
        <br />Harriet, a talented psychic, works for a company that offers
        psychic services in a futuristic society. When she finds herself tangled
        in a dangerous situation involving a mysterious conspiracy, she enlists
        the help of Sam, a former investigator with a dark past. As they uncover
        the secrets surrounding a glass house—a mysterious structure tied to
        their investigation—they must navigate their growing attraction while
        facing hidden dangers.<br />
        <br />
        The novel combines elements of mystery, suspense, and romance, with a
        focus on psychic abilities, futuristic technology, and the complexities
        of relationships. The title, "People in Glass Houses," symbolizes the
        fragile nature of the world the characters inhabit and the
        vulnerabilities they face in their personal and professional lives.
